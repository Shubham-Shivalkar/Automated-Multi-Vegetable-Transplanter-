# 🚜 Automated Multi Vegetable Transplanter  
### Mechanical Design & CAD Development Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents the **mechanical design and CAD development** of an **Automated Multi Vegetable Transplanter**, designed as a complete agricultural automation system.

The project focuses on **system architecture, mechanism design, and engineering validation**, demonstrating practical mechanical design suitable for real-world field operation and competitive evaluation.

## 🎯 Design Objective
To design a **tractor-mounted, single-row automated transplanter** capable of transplanting vegetable saplings such as:
- Chili
- Tomato
- Brinjal  

with **minimal manual intervention**, ensuring accurate placement, consistent spacing, and safe operation.

## 🧩 Major Subsystems Designed

1. **Chassis & Frame**
   - Tractor-mounted attachment structure
   - Designed for structural strength and stability
   - Optimized for manufacturability and assembly

2. **Sapling Pickup System**
   - Automated pickup of saplings from trays
   - Designed to minimize plant damage
   - Supports different sapling sizes

3. **Conveying System**
   - Transfers saplings from pickup to planting zone
   - Maintains plant-to-plant spacing
   - Smooth and controlled motion

4. **Digging (Soil Opening) Mechanism**
   - Opens soil at required depth
   - Designed considering soil interaction and resistance

5. **Sapling Drop Mechanism**
   - Vertical placement of saplings into prepared holes
   - Ensures upright orientation during planting

6. **Soil Covering Mechanism**
   - Covers soil after sapling placement
   - Provides stability to transplanted saplings
